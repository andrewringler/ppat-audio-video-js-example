## Print ArUco Markers easily

This is a small website which allows you to easily print multiple ArUco-markers at once: you can generate a specific number of markers, set the width of the markers and the spacing on the paper.

A Demo can be found here: [tn1ck.github.io/aruco-print](https://tn1ck.github.io/aruco-print)
